During high-social seasons like [college fests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_festivals_in_India) and admission weeks, residents coordinate ‚Äòsink makeovers‚Äô to align with personal style or group identity, often tagging [#SinkSetup](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sinksetup/) and [#ShelfieIndia](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/shelfieindia/).\n\nThis visibility transforms the sink into a form of low-effort personal branding. A well-chosen gel can signal creativity, hygiene discipline, or generosity if it‚Äôs part of a shared refill routine. Over time, the sink has become a curated space where practical utility meets performative belonging‚Äîblending the everyday with a subtle, playful competition for aesthetic and social recognition.",
